## Projects
### Eye Bombing
This was the eye bombing project which I thought was very helpful in terms of thikning more creative and see things in places you dont expect.

### One Tweet
![Poster 1] (https://github.com/peymanmola1/Typography/blob/master/%40ed%20balls.jpg)

This poster is of a @ sign made up of a continuous text of ed balls. I used simple colours in order to emphasise the @ sign in the middle as it is in a red colour, whilst the background consists of black and white.

![Poster 2] (https://github.com/peymanmola1/Typography/blob/master/Justice%20or%20just%20us%20is%20the%20system%20broken.jpg)

Justice or Just us is the system broken may be considered quite a political statement and due to what is happening in America the use of red, white and blue will trigger them thoughts.

![Poster 3] (https://github.com/peymanmola1/Typography/blob/master/we%20can%20neither.jpg)

My thinking behind the CIA tweet was the American flag as it is the secret service of America and I think that people will understand that concept.

For the justice or just us tweet I have made it to resemble a scale balancing justice or just us the colouring is just a simple black and white.

![Poster 5] (https://github.com/peymanmola1/Typography/blob/master/can%20you%20hear%20me%20now.jpg)

The final poster is the Edward Snowden tweet which all I have done is just make the words get bigger. The colours I choose are yellow and light blue this is because they are quite calming colours.

### Union Hack
I really enjoyed the Union hack project as it was a bit challenging to change a flag, the flags that I choose was simple but some of the flags that I have redesigned are all based on what I think of when I think of the country, the Japan flag i had to do a little bit of research for. For my own flag I decided to pick colours which are based on the aura of people.

### Code On Your Plate
For the code on the plate, I really enjoyed this project because I was able to learn how to use HTML and CSS which was quite challenging but was fun as I had to figure out what code was needed in order to create what I had in mind.
