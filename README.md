### One Tweet
![Poster 1] (https://github.com/peymanmola1/Typography/blob/master/%40ed%20balls.jpg)

This poster is of a @ sign made up of a continuous text of ed balls. I used simple colours in order to emphasise the @ sign in the middle as it is in a red colour, whilst the background consists of black and white.

![Poster 2] (https://github.com/peymanmola1/Typography/blob/master/Justice%20or%20just%20us%20is%20the%20system%20broken.jpg)

Justice or Just us is the system broken may be considered quite a political statement and due to what is happening in America the use of red, white and blue will trigger them thoughts.

![Poster 3] (https://github.com/peymanmola1/Typography/blob/master/we%20can%20neither.jpg)

My thinking behind the CIA tweet was the American flag as it is the secret service of America and I think that people will understand that concept.

![Poster 4] (https://github.com/peymanmola1/Typography/blob/master/justice%202.jpg)

For the justice or just us tweet I have made it to resemble a scale balancing justice or just us the colouring is just a simple black and white.

![Poster 5] (https://github.com/peymanmola1/Typography/blob/master/can%20you%20hear%20me%20now.jpg)

The final poster is the Edward Snowden tweet which all I have done is just make the words get bigger. The colours I choose are yellow and light blue this is because they are quite calming colours.
